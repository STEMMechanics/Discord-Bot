# Discord Bot
 
The STEMMechanics Discord bot is a helpful tool to manage and support the [STEMMechanics Discord channel](https://discord.gg/yNzk4x7mpD).

It is a Node.js application using [DiscordJS](https://discord.js.org) to interact with the Discord server.
 
## Submitting Pull Requests
We would love to receive PRs that add functionality and features (module). We ask that all new items be modular and abstracted.

Before adding a new module, we recommend discussing it in our Discord server to ensure that others are aware of your work and provide advice/support.
